# Shopify Theme Customization Project

This repository contains a customized Shopify theme developed during my internship work and hands-on practice with Shopify Theme Customizer.

The focus of this project is **frontend theme customization without heavy Liquid coding**, using Shopify’s built-in customization system to build real, usable ecommerce UI.

## What I Actually Did

- Customized Shopify theme layout using **Theme Customizer**
- Built and configured reusable **sections and blocks**
- Designed product cards with hover effects and animations
- Connected products and collections dynamically via Admin
- Controlled content using `settings_data.json`
- Structured homepage sections for real ecommerce use
- Ensured responsive behavior across screen sizes

No fake demos. No static UI.  
Everything here is **admin-controlled and production-oriented**.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:
- How Shopify themes are structured
- How data flows from Admin → Theme → UI
- How to build flexible sections without hardcoding
- How real ecommerce themes are managed and versioned

This is my **foundation step** before deep Liquid development.

## Note

Most customization was done using Shopify Admin and theme settings.  
Liquid coding was minimal, as the goal was to master **Shopify’s system-first approach** before extending with custom Liquid logic.
